I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, working with Professor Ulrike Malmendier. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2023. I work on behavioral and labor economics topics, mainly in low-income countries.
You can find my CV [here](../files/LC_CV, 20241021.pdf).

**I will be on the Academic Job Market in Fall 2024** \
