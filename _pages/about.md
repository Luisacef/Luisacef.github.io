Welcome! I am a development economist focusing on labor and behavioral questions.

I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, working with Professor Ulrike Malmendier. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2023.

**I will be on the Academic Job Market in Fall 2024**
