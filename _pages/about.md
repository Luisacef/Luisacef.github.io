I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Professor Ulrike Malmendier. **I will be on the Academic Job Market in Fall 2024**

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2023. 

I work on behavioral and labor economics topics, mainly in low-income countries.
